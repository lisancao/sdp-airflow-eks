"""
Vendored SparkPipelinesOperator + SparkPipelinesHook
====================================================

Self-contained re-implementation of the operator merged into Apache Airflow
in March 2026 (PR 61681). Drop in next to the demo DAGs so they work on any
apache-airflow-providers-apache-spark version that includes SparkSubmitHook.

Why vendor: the public provider release that carries the upstream operator
may not match the version pinned in docker/airflow/Dockerfile. Vendoring
removes that coupling. If you later upgrade the provider and want to switch
to the upstream class, change two import lines in the DAGs.

Behavior parity with upstream (per the merged PR description):
  * pipeline_spec       — path to spark-pipeline.yml
  * pipeline_command    — "run" or "dry-run"
  * conn_id             — Airflow Spark connection (default: spark_default)
  * conf, env_vars      — forwarded to the underlying spark-submit invocation
  * num_executors, executor_memory, driver_memory, deploy_mode — Spark resources
  * Templates: pipeline_spec, pipeline_command, conf, env_vars
  * Reuses SparkSubmitHook for connection parsing, env, on-kill cleanup
